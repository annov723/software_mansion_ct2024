Software Engineer Winter Internship 2024 – coding task

Task:

Write a function that receives two sequences: A and B of integers and returns one sequence C. Sequence C should contain all elements from sequence A (maintaining the order) except those, that are present in sequence B p times, where p is a prime number.

Example:

A=[2,3,9,2,5,1,3,7,10] 

B=[2,1,3,4,3,10,6,6,1,7,10,10,10] 

C=[2,9,2,5,7,10] 

Notes: 
1. The time complexity is important – try to write an algorithm with good time complexity and specify it in your answer. 
2. You can choose any reasonable type present in your chosen language to represent the sequence. 
3. Make sure the function signature is correct. 
4. Write your own code to test primality.



*using memory allocation and reallocation to create a result array (needed to pass the outcome to the main function)

*converting string with commas input into separate int values to store them in an array

*using NULL to find the end of arrays passed as pointers into methods
